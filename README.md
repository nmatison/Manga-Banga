# IMPORTANT NOTE
I have forked this from the original: https://github.com/AllaliAdil/Manga-Downloader-Extension

I have updated code so that it will at least work on some sites. I have also added in coloredmanga.com. I will continue to make updates to this on my end as it seems like a fun side project.

# Manga-Downloader-Extension
Firefox extension to download Manga/Manhua/Manhwa/Webtoons/Comics chapters as PDF/ZIP(images) from many websites. I am not enabling on chrome for the time being.
